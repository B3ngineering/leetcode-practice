# leetcode-practice

Easy way for me to keep track of completed Leetcode problems and solutions, should also be helpful for tracking progress. Otherwise hard to stay accountable, the github activity calendar motivates me heavily to stay consistent.

Problems that I've already completed will be in Rust, new ones will be C++ or Python depending on the problem.
